# VPL (Vector Phasor Language)

VPL is a mathematical framework for seeing programs as geometric motion. The idea comes from a combination of electrical engineering, computer science, and mathematics. For years, I kept coming back to a simple thought: why not vectors? After all, we use them to describe almost everything. Later, when I studied compiler construction, everything was different; it was like watching another movie, but it was a good catch on semantics and linguistics. Still, the idea was in motion. So, how to connect this together? Translating semantics into something else, with some rules, so I start pairing stuff, so if with a "While" you can do almost anything... so let a while map to a phasor because both go in circles. Typing well, let's have a Vector space for types, and so on.

With the advent of LLMs well I use chat GPT, I prototyped something, one advantage to know about electrical engineering, computer science and math (this needs to improve) is that I know exactly what I want or at least know when something is off or does not make any logic. Thing is the speed to deliver is quite low without or imposible without LLMs; they are here to stay so we must use them. 

There is work to do. For example, math proving by humans, covering more cases in the model, and testing. I think it has a nice way to shift from "code" to "hardware". We need simpler machines once we know what we want; therefore, converting software to hardware sounds promising, especially for performance reasons and less energy consumption. Finally another reasons is that we need to start working or thingkins in terms of quantum mechanics, which is already defined by vectors, so it would be tempting to map as much as possible to quantum circuits too. 

One additional curiosity I have is to analyze mathematical models for noise calculations, and here comes information theory to the playground, why not...

I will evolve this mathematical framework as much as possible, and it is open for peer review.

# VPL as IR

VPL also is an intermediate represenation language (IR) between software semantics and physical implementations, you can picture it as a translation tool. In a broad picture, once you cross to another domain you adjust and optimize in that domain as the inputs and outputs remain valid. The final test of this is a physical implementation of a complex software library.

Thanks to the Eso lang people for the inspiration. I wish to have read about these programming languages before, not because they were useful but because they teached me to think out of the box the Von Neumann box and stop repeating this dogmatic way to build or event worst reason about computers, and how a computer works or a programming language should be build. 


This language works in the novel principles concepts of linear algebra and quantum Computing. 

Once a wise man said

"Most of the reserved words should end in -anuos- to be properly accepted in the academia" or it was for science fiction book or a movie quote, I don't recall any more. 

Also the same wise man said:

"You need to produce +100 Kg of papers and have 10000+ friends on LinkedIn or OF to become a respectable PhD"

Anyway...

The language runs in a qTape which encodes the instructions in a set of vector space operators  it is originally written for a Qcularor in mind but this technology has not been developed yet, we don't expect that it will take a lot of time to be done it depends on  how much effort society keeps placing to have another mass extintion event or the collapse of the wester civilization which is almost the same. Dynanosaurs lasted 180 M years, not sure if we can do any better, anyway.... For now, it can run on any low tech computers where each core represents a Qbitus and this should suffice for now. The program is executed indefinitely until it is observed at this point it collapses so only one output is available, but since what happens in the Hilbert space remains in the Hilbert space no postmortem analysis is possible, variables and states can't be cloned because of the non cloning theorem.

The qparser is a qASS or q-abstract-syntax-spiner if you are not into the brevery thing. Which does not follow any data structure know for now.

All wrong parsing results collapses so after several iterations the only remaining observations might still valid. The first compilation step is done by the vectorian parser which does strict checking while converting the instructions in a chain of vector phasorial operations for different vector spaces, this is known is type-vector-approach or TVA.
Heresy, like in the movie, if is not computable in the matrix the program is not valid.

The target architecture is meant to run in a  Ion-Trapped-conisphierium that should be a shaped as a really pointy cone to be taken seriously by manufacturers, and it should have a lot of mirrors to look expensive and expensive to get a lot of budget. Of course, It is not invented yet and despite current limitations we can simulate it using a low tech processors. But the intuition of the qASS should suffice and motivate its internal design and production, because humans like to build pointy things but also shiny things. 

At the end who says we need, ALUS, registers, buses, and memory when you could execute billions of random instructions per second in the spin of electrons. Who says that the only way to communicate information inside hardware is using wires, ee, eee, Eeeee! 

A deterministic machine could be also designed using the deterministic version of the Quantum theory but since humans like to play with dices we stick with the quantum - phasorial - vectorian approach.

The first step of design is to transform all this written gibish bullshit from above into symbols defined carefully and proven by axioms and theorems. Later, disprove it, and correct it and disprove it again until it holds true, or partially true, or makes no sense anymore and just give up... Or we break the math and we need a more powerful math...  Discovering something or giving up is a wonderful game in life, it is like harrasing knowledge.  As math is incomplete, physics should be incomplete too and this journey is totally incomplete, so maybe better to give up now. Still there are no excuses to avoid the use of symbols and do the proofing carefully, like one wise man said; "If you don't use symbols and proofs, it is just bullshit" 

The end goals:

- Ion-Trapped-conisphierium (TBD)
- Vectorian Phasor language VPL (Under Work)
- Fabrications (TBD) We are not sure why we need this, something with a machine setup
- Oraculization (TBD) Not sure what it will do, something with an Oracle because that sounds important lately.
- Coinshufering (TBD) Something with probability, idk, toss coins...
 
VPL:

A vector is defined by a direction and magnitude, and if it starts spinning is a phasor. You know what else spins...  electrons, wheels, motors, the planet earth, and maybe the universe a bit surely no one knows. 

Rules:

- All assignments are vectors 
- All operators do vector operations
- All math operations results are vectors 
- Data types are vectors too but in different spaces, as the vector space will be divided by types. Type casting is defined by a travel to a different Vectorial space.
- All loops are phasors because both go in circles 
- All decision statements are phasors too because everything could be done with a "While" (Where is my programming analysis book). 90 degrees means true and -90 means false, like when looking into the sky or into the ground while going to an urinary. 
- All numbers are vectors

Help wanted! If you think you can help to make new tech go for one of the objective start prototyping, and create a MR,  with your name and reference to your original sources if there is any. All will be shared with a GPL License and be free for the world to copy/paste. The end goal is to have less power consumption so we can advance civilization to the next level before we consume all our resources! If you think you can't help study physics, math, engineering and computer science and after 10 years come back..

  I will be using chat GTP to help me with my wild ideas... shame on me.
