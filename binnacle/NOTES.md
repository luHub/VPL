## Thoughts 

The amount of bullshit generated for V0.0.2 is astonishing but enterteining. Now the fun part will be to produce some usefull result
and start all over again for V0.0.3. So we will expand the compiler, now, here are my actual 2 cents on this... see, we start
from the compiler with a sensitive grammar "C language" and we go from there.

## More next next steps 2025_10_X

As the master paper growths, it revealed a structure, that it is, the information needs a word by word examination.
But we will start journey from the compilers code, and later fix the mathematical framework. 


## Next steps 2025_10_X

I will focus on the compiler for now and do a full FFT implementation, first by adding testing to all the parts of the compiler.
Once this works. Proof by mathematical testing all the sections.  Once that works create another model adding observability to VPL.

## Obsevation Matrix (Posponed for now) 2025_10_X

Wild Idea: Not implemented. Once the framework is completed create an "Observation Matrix". Now, think of a "System" that could
"observe" reallity and reallity depicted by VPL, well a vectorial representation given by VPL of an algorithm, later do "inference" about the "observation" based on some "observability mechanism". But this might complicate the model we could do it as an expansion model later. Once all is verified and corrected, we will add this in future versions.

## Hallucinations and fun 2025_10_X

Adding some primitive blocks to VPL, if all this wrong it would be fun to disprove it. If is all right, this will start to get spooky when I add more direction into the unknown. if is right/wrong would be a very good experience to split both

## Does a while loop has noice 2025_10_16

This is one of the questions that would be fun to answer, "the noise of semantics" when transformed to different physical implementations. 
As VPL evolves we could do some metrics to answer this question. 

## Specialization vs Generalization 2025_10_16

The quest for discovery of new things could be impacted with this mythic question about Specialization vs Generalization.
  
"Jack of all trades, master of none" vs "If you only got a hammer, everything is a tool".

In my opinion, the flaw becomes not in one or another but placing them as opposing forces, which given time
constraints, classification, categorization, and infinite amount of knowledge to be harvested it sounds a promising way
to favor one or the other. At the end is about infinite knowledge vs time. It is tempting to only focus on one thing, but
one thing disconnected from all the other things is worthless. 

So we should see specialization and generalization as expansion and contraction, or as a cycle. In that sense the exercise to 
generalize and specialize over and over could act as a pump to extract knowledge, and the setting on how deep and how superficial we
want to go is what will define our success.

VPL migh suffer from this between "opposing" forces in mathematics, physics, and engineering. If is too theoretical there will be no applied purpouse if 
is full of purpose will not haverst unkown knoledge. So if a fun game to play with.

## While Loops 2025_10_11

To understand what we are doing, which most of the time we don't know, a careful analysis of what has been done is needed, in the words of a famous unknown person.. "Do some reading"

So well we started the example with a "while loop" thinking yeah... but w while loop is not as innocent as we think. It required thousand of years of civilization to be useful in the society. But the idea was there for hundred years ago.

- Could we express a while loop in terms of linear algebra? 
- Could we map it to oscillators? 
- What are the benefits and limitations? 
- Could we reason about a while loop differently?
