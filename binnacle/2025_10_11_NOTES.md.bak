## While Loops

To understand what we are doing, which most of the time we don't know, a carefulanalysis of what has been done is needed, in the worls of a famous unknown persoson.. "Do some reading"

So well we started the exmaple with a "while loop" thinkings yeah... but w while loop is not as innocent as we think. It required thousand of years of civilization to be usefull in the society. But the idea was there for hundred years ago.

- Could we express a while loop in terms of linear algebra? 
- Could we map it to oscillarots? 
- What are the benefits and limitations? 
- Could we reason about a while loop differently?
