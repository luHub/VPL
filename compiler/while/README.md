# While


## V0.0.2:

- PoC "While with a nested While"
- Will Continue parsing C syntax
- We could think ahead what a while inside a while means in the circuit domain
- Simulation should be as simple as possible. we will assume a counter inside a counter case. 

## V0.0.1: 

- PoC Compiler pipeline end to end to convert a while loop into VPL spec, run VPL mathematical simulator and create circuit representations. 
- We could split the problem into different pieces.
- We are not 100% sure about the results each component will require validation and enhancement since chatGTP could hallucinate and write a lot non sense. 
-Splitting the problem into smaller problems with a clean interface might help to isolate issues and to enhance each part without affecting others. 
- Some results might need to adjust the "paper" but the intuition remains the same. Therefore paper v0.0.2 will start. But we are not still sure of anything.
