# Compiler

The VPL compiler will be versioned based on examples. Each version will be unique until it evolves in 2 possible direction

## Evolution Direction

- As a compiler for a specific algorihm.
- As a compiler for all algorithms.

## Specific Algorihm Compiler

Given that each algorithm might end up given different functionalities this appoach is choosen to understant better the outcome of the 
transformations.

## All in one compiler

This will arise naturally as more algorithms are mapped to hardware


## Compipler Pipeline

(Start)->(AST)->(VPL)->(Optimization)->(Hardware Specification)
