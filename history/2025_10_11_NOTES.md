## While Loops

To understand what we are doing, which most of the time we don't know, a careful analysis of what has been done is needed, in the words of a famous unknown person.. "Do some reading"

So well we started the example with a "while loop" thinking yeah... but w while loop is not as innocent as we think. It required thousand of years of civilization to be useful in the society. But the idea was there for hundred years ago.

- Could we express a while loop in terms of linear algebra? 
- Could we map it to oscillators? 
- What are the benefits and limitations? 
- Could we reason about a while loop differently?
