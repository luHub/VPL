# Changes

## Added V0.0.2
- More references that we must need to verify
- Table of Contents
- Idea: Mappings for matrix M of VPL from different domains. Just an idea, since text was generated with chat GTP it requires theoretical proving, references, and of course a PoC that next versions should address.
- Idea: VPL Primitives as basic blocks of Algorithmic construction
  
## Based on V0.0.1 compiler pipeline for while example:

- Added references
- Added related work
- Rewrote Formal model
- Rewrote Control
- Rewrote Examples
