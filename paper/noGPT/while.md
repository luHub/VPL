We will visit for now "Revised Report on the Algorithmic Language Algol 60". Later, move to the older sources to see if we could find more information.

## Revised Report on the Algorithmic Language Algol 60

From:

```
<separator>::=  while

4.6.1. Syntax
```
<arithmetic expression> while <Boolean expression>
```

```

## VPL

It would be nice to map the "while" to the Antikythera mechanism (100 BCE) and Jacquard's loom machines. The intuition is that if these machines could be described
in terms of Vectors or differential equations or VPL. We could have another link betwen a physical realization and programming semantics.
