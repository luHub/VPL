# While

## V0.0.1: 

- PoC Compiler pipeline end to end to convert a while loop into VPL spec, run VPL mathematical simulator and create circuit representations. 
- We could split the problem into different pieces.
- We are not 100% sure about the results each component will require validation and enhancement since chatGTP could hallucinate and write a lot non sense. Splitting the problem
into smaller problems with a clean interface might help to isolate issues and to enhance each part without affecting others. 
- Some results might need to adjust the "paper" but the intuition remains the same.
